The area owes its agricultural prominence to the grasslands that they were converted from. It has been estimated that 73\\(\\%\\) of the grassland that were present in the GT prior ro European settlement of region have been lost to land conversion. In the case of wheat production, the balance between an insect pest of wheat (the wheat stem sawfly) and its natural enemies has been disrupted, resulting in epidemic outbreaks of wheat steam sawfly(WSS) infestation in wheat fields.The specialist parasitoids B. cephi and B. lissogaster require a WSS larvae feeding inside a grass or wheat stem as host for their offspring. They also require diets rich in carbohydrates and other nutrients compounds to achieve maximum livelihood and increase traits associated with fecundity. Because little is known about the floral resources that may be important to the parasitoids, a two year survey was conducted of an intact grassland plot(12 ha) located within the GT. During each survey(~6 per season, every two weeks) we recorded the location, species, and quantity of actively flowering plants encountered. We also retrieved LiDAR digital elevation model and daily weather observations to model the spatiotemporal context of our observed flowering plants. This model may help us to understand which species of flora warrant further investigation as supplemental resources for the specialist parasitoids of WSS based on their temporal alignment with the braconidss phenology and observed spatial distribution. We anticipate the culmination of this project will help inform future research on providing supplemental nutrition to parasitoids of WSS in the field setting. We would like to identify plants native to our study region that may provide the parasitoids with similar benefits to that of buck wheat and cowpea. 1.1 Data Collection Surveys of flowering plants were conducted on a 12-ha relic grassland located on the northern Agricultural Research Center (NARC), south of Havre, Montana. The mean annual precipitation recorded in Havre over the past 30 years is 305 mm and the average temperature is 9 degress C. This grassland site has been protected from development and livestock grazing since 1916, making the present flora similar to what may inhabit analogous areas in the absence of anthropogenic factors. Trips to the site were made every two weeks between June and September of 2019 and 2020. Belt transects 10 meters wide running the length of the site were plotted. The distance between each transect was also 10 meters, effectively meaning half of the site was surveyed. The lowland areas in the center of the plot was excluded due to the difficulty of sampling presented by the dense vegetation. Surveys consisted of the GPS location, species, and quantity of the actively flowering plants. To diminish impacts on the area and plant disturbances, photos were taken for later species identification. Sampling locations were resampled to a 5 meter grid to account for unknown spatial accuracy of the GPS unit used (Garmin Oregon 450). In total we collected 9720 point observations of actively flowering plants from 61 different species. Each point observation consists of the specie(s) observed, status of species in Montana (i.e. weed, native, species of concern, etc) quantity of species, latitude, longitude , date the observation was recorded. 2 Data Description and Methods The data that were used for this paper came from three primary sources. The first is a list of all flower species that were found on the plot of land the data were collected from. There were 65 species, each of which had their scientific and common names included, as well as a Montana Field Guide Conservation Score. This score takes on integer values from 0 to 5, indicating how well each species can respond to changes in the surrounding environment. One of the filters that was used for determining ideal candidate species was having a score of 2 or 3, which indicates that a species can grow in a wide range of environments and adapt well to changes, but is not invasive either. The second file contains weather data for a station near the plot of land. For each day in 2019 and 2020, information is included for mean air temperature in degrees Celsius, mean soil temperature in degrees Celsius at depths of 0, 4, 8, 20 and 36 inches and millimeters of precipitation received. When calculating growing degree days, the difference between mean daily temperature and a particular threshold temperature (0 and 4 degrees Celsius were considered) is the value for growing degree days for a given day if that value is positive and 0 otherwise. Values for growing degree days for each day as well as cumulative growing degree days for a year were calculated. For six dates in 2019 and five dates in 2020, data were collected at numerous different points throughout the plot. Within a certain distance of each of these points, which was typically a few meters, it was noted which flower species were present and in what quantity. The notable variables included x and y coordinates, mean elevation in feet, mean aspect, which takes on a value from 0 to 360 and corresponds to which direction the slope faces, mean slope in degrees and mean roughness. For the purpose of modeling, aspect was transformed to an indicator for north facing slopes. That is, 1 if the mean aspect was between 0 and 90 or 270 and 360, and 0 otherwise. 3 Poisson Point Process Models An inhomogenous poisson point process model was used to glean insights to the distribution of species in terms of favorable or unfavorable terrain characteristics. The approach used was to fit an individual model for each species. These models are based on two main assumptions: Observed points are independent of each other. That is, the presence of one point in a region, \\(B \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2\\), is not related to the presence of other points in the same region. The number of points (flower observations) within a region,B, has a poisson distribution, and the expected count of points within a region is = \\(\\int_{region}\\lambda(u)du\\), where \\(\\lambda(u)\\) is the intensity (average number of points per unit area) of points at the location \\(u \\in B\\). Each model produces an intensity surface across the survey area according to log-linear poisson likelihood, where the points \\(u\\) correspond to pixels in the survey area. \\[P(N(u)) \\sim Pois(\\lambda(u))\\] To estimate the intensity with respect to the terrain covariates we use a log-linear intensity function: \\[ \\lambda(u)=exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1aspect_u + \\beta_2slope_u + \\beta_3roughness_u) \\] Here, the log-linear intensity function imposes another assumption, that intensity increases or decreases exponentially as a function of aspect, slope, and roughness. Aspect was defined as a 1 for northfacing areas and 0 for south facing areas. The coefficients \\(\\beta\\) represent the expected increase in log-intensity for a 1 unit increase in the corresponding variable (aspect, roughness, slope). \\(\\beta\\) with large magnitude represent strong underlying relationships with terrain covariates for a given species, while \\(\\beta\\) close to 0 indicate that the species is relatively unaffected by the terrain covariate. The model coefficients then represent estimates of the relationship between a species presence at a given location with observed terrain characteristics. For the context of understanding the individual terrain preferences of a species, the magnitude of the estimated coefficients represent the relative importance of a particular terrain covariate. For example, a species with a large estimated coefficient on aspect is more likely to grow on a north facing slope. To identify species which will grow well on any given terrain, species with low-magnitude coefficients should be prioritized. 4 Limitations There is likely some large violation of the assumption of point-wise independence. From visual investigation of flower observations, there is evidence of some clustering, especially with respect to those species with limited observations. We recommend limiting inferences from this modeling approach to species with many observations that dont appear to violate the assumption of independence. Although not considered here, Ripleys K-function can quantify the degree of clustering for a given species. The assumption of a log-linear intensity with respect to terrain covariates limits the intensity to be exponential and uni-directional as a function of a given terrain covariate. This means that for a given species, the relationship between a particular terrain covariate and the estimated intensity can only increase or decrease in an exponential form. Considering that a species may have an optimal terrain type, future work should aim to fit a similar model that includes polynomial terrain coefficients, for example, \\(roughness^2\\). The introduction of polynomial predictors will allow for bi-directional intensities as a function fo particular terrain covariates. Additionally, interaction terms were not considered in these models, although the true existance of interaction effects may exist. For example slope may mediate the relationship of intensity with roughness. That is, a species may grow poorly on rough terrain with a low slope, but may grow particularly well on rough terrain with a high slope. Future modeling should consider the existance of interaction effects between terrain covariates. 5 Results Given the sparsity of some species, we limit inferences from the modeling approach to species with greater than 50 observations. load(&quot;flower_df_final.RData&quot;) print(flower_inf_50) Spp Native EFN site_count_total X.Intercept. aspect 1 Achillea millefolium Y N 818 -5.718438 0.51286739 2 Artemisia cana Y N 455 -5.869409 -0.03951686 3 Aster falcatus Y N 368 -6.932986 0.79213193 4 Astragalus gracilis Y N 56 -9.419218 1.59946826 5 Campanula rotundifolia Y N 51 -16.166422 4.06063665 6 Dalea purpurea Y N 158 -9.693543 1.49781953 7 Gaillardia aristata Y N 89 -11.398335 3.05227178 8 Gaura coccinea Y N 188 -7.602321 0.29509307 9 Gutierrezia sarothrae Y N 158 -7.624619 0.57125642 10 Heterotheca villosa Y N 776 -7.089435 1.32901975 11 Lactuca serriola N N 91 -7.754809 0.10793036 12 Liatris punctata Y N 373 -7.679065 1.16540872 13 Linum lewisii Y N 262 -10.253449 3.26841431 14 Lygodesmia juncea Y N 221 -7.268027 1.32619280 15 Medicago sativa N N 739 -4.650676 0.14215439 16 Melilotus officinalis N N 596 -5.670917 0.42246709 17 Opuntia polyacantha Y N 70 -7.079888 -0.48093877 18 Pediomelum argophyllum Y N 469 -7.126978 0.76105499 19 Ratibida columnifera Y N 244 -8.359521 1.35178880 20 Rosa arkansana Y N 159 -9.711195 1.18466167 21 Solidago mollis Y N 156 -8.557659 1.11322303 22 Sphaeralcea coccinea Y N 217 -5.871607 -0.28995447 23 Symphoricarpos albus Y N 54 -8.432866 -0.09250767 24 Tragopogon dubius N N 819 -4.949960 -0.06645663 25 Vicia americana Y N 736 -5.047165 0.86299092 26 Xanthisma spinulosum Y N 147 -6.148943 -0.11120230 27 Zigadenus venenosus Y N 119 -10.252582 2.32896249 roughness slope 1 0.06380032 0.06741828 2 -0.04307192 0.07524466 3 0.72878656 -0.04519392 4 0.24791285 0.06015339 5 -0.05822954 0.59523519 6 0.41501348 0.21252060 7 -1.06275745 0.51104364 8 -0.15132469 0.20902971 9 -0.37295830 0.20782214 10 -0.13461764 0.22577125 11 0.37785457 0.01485632 12 0.23359601 0.14319710 13 -1.25768323 0.51998805 14 -0.97057843 0.22384832 15 -0.67564227 0.01974873 16 -0.37191551 0.10506939 17 -1.24359383 0.25852545 18 -0.09628358 0.21302055 19 -0.15979358 0.24702272 20 -0.36724530 0.41942710 21 1.32035164 -0.09715459 22 0.21433256 -0.11795033 23 2.78460742 -0.50125171 24 -0.48824448 0.11247598 25 -0.70525101 -0.01130366 26 -2.25487761 0.39645771 27 -0.90148928 0.46136773 5.1 Including Figures and Tables created by R code 5.1.1 Adding a Figure Make sure that figures have a fig.cap (figure caption). You can use either out.width for sizing or fig.height and fig.width. To get R to scale graphics appropriately I find that oversizing a figure works nicely. For example, even though letter paper is 8.5 x 11 I will set a figure that I want to use half the page to fig.width=10 and fig.height=6. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 5.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 5.1. 5.1.2 Adding a Table Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 5.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 5.1: Here is a nice table!

The images are there because they were used to create the palates in the package. Lets import one of those images. Since I dont know where the yarrr package is stored on your computer and the delimiter used by your operating system, I will use R functions to find the path and to create the file path. knitr::include_graphics(file.path(path.package(&quot;yarrr&quot;), &quot;nemo.jpg&quot;)) Figure 5.2: Finding nemo image from yarr package. 5.3 Including citations You can write citations, too.
